In this project, I perform an Exploratory data analysis and Logistic regression on a dataset. From this work you should see that I have used a local CSV file. This is just a disclaimer, but I will make the file available later. In the meantime; Please consider staring this project. That will help me create more.

First is the exploration of to see the shape of the data. That is the Rows and columns involved. Next is the relationship analysis to see the relationship between the various rows and columns. For this, I used the seaborn library for the graphs and heatmaps. Used “pairplot” from the seaborn library to sum up the remaining relations.

Second comes data wrangling or cleaning. I checked for any null values for rectification. Then I dropped some of the rows which I thought were not necessary. For the rows with string values, I used ‘get_dummies’ from the ‘pandas’ library to convert them to categorical variables. Used the same library to concatenate them to the data set. 

I used the ‘sklearn’ library for the logistic regression process. That is splitting the data, training the model, fitting the model, to evaluating the performance. My model did predict with 80% accuracy and about 50% precision.

I hope you find what you’re looking for in this project and I am looking forward to your  contribution.
